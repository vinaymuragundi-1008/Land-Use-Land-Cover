**🌍 Land Use Land Cover (LULC) Analysis Using ISRO Bhuvan Data**

This project focuses on analyzing Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) patterns using satellite-derived geospatial datasets obtained from the ISRO Bhuvan Geoportal. The study provides insights into land distribution, environmental changes, and human activity patterns in the selected region.
The dataset contains information such as agricultural land, forests, built-up areas, wasteland, water bodies, and other land classes. The analysis supports environmental planning, resource monitoring, and sustainable land management.

**📌 Project Overview**

This project aims to perform spatial analysis and visualization of land use/land cover categories using data downloaded from the Bhuvan LULC service provided by ISRO.
It includes:
	•	Downloading LULC raster/vector data from Bhuvan
	•	Preprocessing the dataset (cleaning, clipping, CRS handling)
	•	Classifying land cover types
	•	Calculating area statistics for each LULC class
	•	Visualizing land distribution using charts and maps
	•	Generating insights for environmental and regional planning

The project is developed using Python (GeoPandas, Rasterio, Matplotlib) for GIS processing and visualization.
